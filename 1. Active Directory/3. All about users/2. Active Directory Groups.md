# Active Directory Groups
## Types of Groups
Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: `type` and `scope`. The `group type` defines the group's purpose, while the `group scope` shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. When creating a new group, we must select a group type. There are two main types: `security` and `distribution` groups.

### Group Type 
The `Security groups` type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time.

The `Distribution groups` type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members.

### Group Scopes
There are three different `group scopes` that can be assigned when creating a new group.
1. Domain Local Group
2. Global Group
3. Universal Group
#### Domain Local Group
Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local groups cannot be used in other domains but `CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains. Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.
#### Global Group
Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. A global group can only contain accounts from the domain where it was created. Global groups can be added to both other global groups and local groups.
#### Universal Group
The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`.

## Nested Group Membership
Nested group membership is an important concept in AD. As mentioned previously, a Domain Local Group can be a member of another Domain Local Group in the same domain. Through this membership, a user may inherit privileges not assigned directly to their account or even the group they are directly a member of, but rather the group that their group is a member of. This can sometimes lead to unintended privileges granted to a user that are difficult to uncover without an in-depth assessment of the domain.

## Important Group Attributes
Like users, groups have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm). Some of the most [important group attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/group-objects) include:
- `cn`: The `cn` or Common-Name is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services.
- `member`: Which user, group, and contact objects are members of the group.
- `groupType`: An integer that specifies the group type and scope.
- `memberOf`: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member (nested group membership).
- `objectSid`: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.
