## Boxes To Pwn, Videos To Help Visualize

The Hack The Box main platform has many targets for learning and practicing AD enumeration and attacks. Some boxes worth checking out are:
- [Active](https://youtu.be/jUc1J31DNdw)
- [Resolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KJebvmd1Fk)
- [Forest](https://youtu.be/H9FcE_FMZio)
- [Cascade](https://youtu.be/mr-fsVLoQGw)
Ippsec has recorded videos explaining the paths through many of these boxes and more. If you get stuck or want a great primer dealing with Active Directory and see how some of the tools work, check out the video links above.

## More AD Learning Opportunities
Pro Labs are large simulated corporate networks that teach skills applicable to real-life penetration testing engagements. The Dante Pro Lab is an excellent place to start with varying vectors and some AD exposure. The Offshore Pro Lab is an intermediate-level lab that contains a wealth of opportunities for practicing AD enumeration and common and less common attacks.

- [Offshore](https://app.hackthebox.com/prolabs/overview/offshore) Pro Lab
There are more advanced Pro Labs available too.
For more practice specific to AD, check out the [AD Track](https://app.hackthebox.com/tracks/Active-Directory-101) as well. Tracks are curated lists of machines and challenges for users to work through and master a particular topic. The AD Track contains boxes of varying difficulties with a variety of attack vectors. Even if you are unable to solve these boxes on your own, it is still worth working with them with a walkthrough or video or just watching the video on the box by Ippsec.

## Closing Thoughts
Between the HTB Discord, Forums, and blogs, there are plenty of amazing write-ups to help advance your skills along the way. One to pay attention to would be [0xdf's walkthroughs](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/tags.html#active-directory). These are also a great resource to get an idea of how an Active Directory attack path may look in the real world. 0xdf writes about much more, and his blog is an excellent resource.

We would be remiss not to mention Sean Metcal's amazing [Active Directory Security blog](https://adsecurity.org/?author=2). This blog is a treasure trove of information and worth perusing.
