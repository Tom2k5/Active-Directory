## Trusts
A trust is used to establish `forest-forest` or `domain-domain` authentication, allowing users to access resources in (or administer) another domain outside of the domain their account resides in. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains.

| **Trust Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Parent-child` | Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.                                                                |
| `Cross-link`   | A trust between child domains to speed up authentication, skip parent-child trust.                                                                                     |
| `External`     | A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering.     |
| `Tree-root`    | A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest. |
| `Forest`       | A transitive trust between two forest root domains.                                                                                                                    |

#### Trust Example

![Diagram of Inlanefreight Forest showing trust types: Parent-child, Cross-link, External, Tree-root, and Forest. Domains include inlanefreight, corp.inlanefreight, wh.corp.inlanefreight, dev.inlanefreight, freightlogistics, and shippinglanes.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/trusts-diagram.png)

Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.
- A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts.
	- Meaning: A trusts B and B trusts C ⇒ A trusts C.
- In a non-transitive trust, only the child domain itself is trusted.
	- Meaning: A only trusts B.
Trusts can be set up to be one-way or two-way (bidirectional).
- In bidirectional trusts, users from both trusting domains can access resources.
- In a one-way trust, only users in a trusted domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa. The direction of trust is opposite to the direction of access.
