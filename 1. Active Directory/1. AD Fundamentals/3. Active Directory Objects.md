# Active Directory Objects
**An object** can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers.
#### AD Objects

#### Users
**Users** in Active Directory (AD) are **leaf objects**, meaning they cannot contain other objects. Each user is a **security principal**, with a unique **SID** and **GUID**. User objects can have **hundreds of attributes** (e.g., name, email, login time, manager, etc.). While most environments don’t populate every attribute, AD supports **over 800 possible attributes**. Users are high-value targets for attackers, even low-privileged ones, as they can help **enumerate the domain** and access resources.

#### Contacts
A contact object is usually used to represent an external user and contains informational attributes such as first name, last name, email address, telephone number, etc. They are `leaf objects` and are NOT security principals (securable objects), so they don't have a SID, only a GUID. An example would be a contact card for a third-party vendor or a customer.

#### Printers
A printer object points to a printer accessible within the AD network. Like a contact, a printer is a `leaf object` and not a security principal, so it only has a GUID. Printers have attributes such as the printer's name, driver information, port number, etc.

#### Computers
A computer object is any computer joined to the AD network (workstation or server). Computers are `leaf objects` because they do not contain other objects. However, they are considered security principals and have a SID and a GUID. Like users, they are prime targets for attackers since full administrative access to a computer (as the all-powerful `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account) grants similar rights to a standard domain user and can be used to perform the majority of the enumeration tasks that a user account can (save for a few exceptions across domain trusts.)

#### Shared Folders
A shared folder object points to a shared folder on the specific computer where the folder resides. Shared folders can have stringent access control applied to them and can be either accessible to, unauthenticated users, authenticated users, or be locked down to only allow certain users/groups access. Anyone not explicitly allowed access will be denied from listing or reading its contents. Shared folders only have a GUID. A shared folder's attributes can include the name, location on the system, security access rights.

#### Groups
A group is considered a `container object` because it can contain other objects, including users, computers, and even other groups. A group has a SID and a GUID. In AD, groups are a way to manage user permissions and access to other securable objects. Instead of adding the users one by one, we could add the group, and the users would inherit the intended permissions via their membership in the group. In Active Directory, we commonly see what are called "[nested groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/nesting-a-group-in-another-group)" (a group added as a member of another group), which can lead to a user(s) obtaining unintended rights. Nested group membership is something we see and often leverage during penetration tests. The tool [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) helps to discover attack paths within a network and illustrate them in a graphical interface. It is excellent for auditing group membership and uncovering/seeing the sometimes unintended impacts of nested group membership. Groups in AD can have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm), the most common being the name, description, membership, and other groups that the group belongs to.

#### OUs
**Organizational Units (OUs)** are **containers** in Active Directory used to group similar objects (users, groups, computers). They help **organize** the domain and allow **delegation of administrative tasks** without giving full admin rights.
**Delegated tasks** can include:
- Resetting passwords
- Creating/deleting users
- Modifying group memberships
- Managing Group Policy links
OUs are especially useful for **Group Policy** management (e.g., applying stricter password rules for service accounts). Key attributes: name, child objects, security settings, etc.
**Example structure:**
```
OU: Employees
    └── OU: Marketing
    └── OU: HR
    └── OU: Finance
    └── OU: Help Desk
```

#### Domain
A domain is the structure of an AD network. Domains contain objects such as users and computers, which are organized into container objects: groups and OUs. Every domain has its own separate database and sets of policies that can be applied to any and all objects within the domain. Some policies are set by default (and can be tweaked), such as the domain password policy. In contrast, others are created and applied based on the organization's need, such as blocking access to cmd.exe for all non-administrative users or mapping shared drives at log in.

#### Domain Controllers
Domain Controllers are essentially the brains of an AD network. They handle authentication requests, verify users on the network, and control who can access the various resources in the domain. All access requests are validated via the domain controller and privileged access requests are based on predetermined roles assigned to users. It also enforces security policies and stores information about every other object in the domain.

#### Sites
A site in AD is a set of computers across one or more subnets connected using high-speed links. They are used to make replication across domain controllers run efficiently.

#### Built-in
In AD, built-in is a container that holds [default groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups) in an AD domain. They are predefined when an AD domain is created.

#### Foreign Security Principals
A foreign security principal (FSP) is an object created in AD to represent a security principal that belongs to a trusted external forest. They are created when an object such as a user, group, or computer from an external (outside of the current) forest is added to a group in the current domain. They are created automatically after adding a security principal to a group. Every foreign security principal is a placeholder object that holds the SID of the foreign object (an object that belongs to another forest.) Windows uses this SID to resolve the object's name via the trust relationship. FSPs are created in a specific container named ForeignSecurityPrincipals with a distinguished name like `cn=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.
