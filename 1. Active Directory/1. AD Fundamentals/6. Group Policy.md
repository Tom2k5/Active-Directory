A [Group Policy Object (GPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to `user(s)` or `computer(s)`. Every GPO has a unique name and is assigned a unique identifier (a GUID). They can be linked to a specific OU, domain, or site. A single GPO can be linked to multiple containers, and any container can have multiple GPOs applied to it. They can be applied to individual users, hosts, or groups by being applied directly to an OU. Every GPO contains one or more Group Policy settings that may apply at the local machine level or within the Active Directory context.
## Example GPOs
Some examples of things we can do with GPOs may include:
- Establishing different password policies for service accounts, admin accounts, and standard user accounts using separate GPOs
- Preventing the use of removable media devices (such as USB devices)
- Enforcing a screensaver with a password
- Restricting access to applications that a standard user may not need, such as cmd.exe and PowerShell
- Enforcing audit and logging policies
- Blocking users from running certain types of programs and scripts
- Deploying software across a domain
- Blocking users from installing unapproved software
- Displaying a logon banner whenever a user logs into a system
- Disallowing LM hash usage in the domain
- Running scripts when computers start/shutdown or when a user logs in/out of their machine

## GPO Order of Precedence

#### GPO Precedence Order
GPOs are processed from the top down when viewing them from a domain organizational standpoint. A GPO linked to an OU at the highest level in an Active Directory network (at the domain level, for example) would be processed first, followed by those linked to a child OU, etc.

```ad-note
If there are many GPOs in different scopes applied to, GPOs from Child OU Policy is precedence over else. 
```
#### Linked Order

This image also shows an example of several GPOs being linked to the `Corp` OU. When more than one GPO is linked to an OU, they are processed based on the `Link Order`. The GPO with the lowest Link Order is processed last, or the GPO with link order 1 has the highest precedence, then 2, and 3, and so on. So in our example above, the `Disallow LM Hash` GPO will have precedence over the `Block Removable Media` and `Disable Guest Account` GPOs, meaning it will be processed first.

```ad-note
If there are many GPOs in same scopes applied to, GPOs in first order is precedence over else. 
```

#### Enforced GPO Policy Precedence
- `Enforced` option to enforce settings in a specific GPO. If this option is set, policy settings in GPOs linked to lower OUs `CANNOT` override the settings.
- If a GPO is set at the domain level with the `Enforced` option selected, the settings contained in that GPO will be applied to all OUs in the domain and cannot be overridden by lower-level OU policies.
Below we can see an example of an `Enforced` GPO, where the `Logon Banner` GPO is taking precedence over GPOs linked to lower OUs and therefore will not be overridden.

#### Block Inheritance
- `Block inheritance` option on an OU ->  If this is specified for a particular OU, then policies higher up (such as at the domain level) will NOT be applied to this OU.
Here is a quick example. The `Computers` OU is inheriting GPOs set on the `Corp` OU in the below image.

![Group Policy Management interface showing Computers under INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Linked Group Policy Objects: Logon Banner, Disable Forced Restarts, Disallow LM Hash, Block Removable Media, Disable Guest Account, Default Domain Policy, all enabled.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/inheritance.png)

If the `Block Inheritance` option is chosen, we can see that the 3 GPOs applied higher up to the `Corp` OU are no longer enforced on the `Computers` OU as well as domain GPOs, except for enforced GPOs.

# Practical Exercises
- What Group Policy Object is created when the domain is created?
=> Default Domain Policy
-  Computer settings for Group Policies are gathered and applied at a <___> minute interval? (answer is a number, fill in the blank )
=> 90
- True or False: A policy applied to a user at the domain level would be overwritten by a policy at the site level.
=> False
