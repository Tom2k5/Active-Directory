# Active-Directory (in progress)

Active Directory Attack and Defend is a hands-on project designed to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios within a Windows enterprise environment. The project focuses on common Active Directory vulnerabilities, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, and domain enumeration, while also implementing defensive techniques like monitoring, hardening, and detection. It aims to strengthen practical skills in both offensive and defensive operations, following the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
