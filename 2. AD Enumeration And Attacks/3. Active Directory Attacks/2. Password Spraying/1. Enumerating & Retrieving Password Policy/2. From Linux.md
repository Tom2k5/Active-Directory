# Overview
 **We can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials.**

# Enumerating the Password Policy 

## Credentialed

**With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or `rpcclient`.**

**Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind.**
## SMB NULL Sessions
SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as `enum4linux`, `CrackMapExec`, `rpcclient`, etc.

### Using rpcclient
We can use [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.

Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as `querydominfo` to obtain information about the domain and confirm NULL session access, then obtain the password policy. We can see that the password policy is relatively weak, allowing a minimum password of 8 characters.

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```

```shell-session

rpcclient $> querydominfo

Domain:		INLANEFREIGHT

Unknown 3:	0x1

rpcclient $> getdompwinfo
min_password_length: 8
password_properties: 0x00000001
	DOMAIN_PASSWORD_COMPLEX
```

#### Using enum4linux
Let's try this using [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux). `enum4linux` is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient` and `smbclient` to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains.

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5

```ad-info
The tool [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng) is a rewrite of `enum4linux` in Python, but has additional features such as the ability to export data as YAML or JSON files which can later be used to process the data further or feed it to other tools.
```

## LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as `windapsearch.py`, `ldapsearch`, `ad-ldapdomaindump.py`, etc., to pull the password policy. With [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch), it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. One example command to get the password policy is as follows:
### Using ldapsearch

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
