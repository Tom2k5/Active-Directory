We've now pulled the password policy in numerous ways. Let's go through the policy for the `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain piece by piece.

- The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
- The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
- The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
- Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
- Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (`Password1` or `Welcome1` would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

| Policy                                      | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Enforce password history                    | 24 days       |
| Maximum password age                        | 42 days       |
| Minimum password age                        | 1 day         |
| Minimum password length                     | 7             |
| Password must meet complexity requirements  | Enabled       |
| Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled      |
| Account lockout duration                    | Not set       |
| Account lockout threshold                   | 0             |
| Reset account lockout counter after         | Not set       |

Do not want to be the pentester that locks out every account in the organization!
