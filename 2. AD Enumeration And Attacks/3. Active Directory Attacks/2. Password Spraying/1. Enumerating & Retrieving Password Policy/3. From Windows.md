# Overview
 **We can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials.**

---
# Enumerating the Password Policy
## Null Session
It is less common to do this type of null session attack from Windows, but we could use the command `net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:""` to establish a null session from a windows machine and confirm if we can perform more of this type of attack.

#### Establish a null session from windows

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:""
The command completed successfully.
```

We can also use a username/password combination to attempt to connect. Let's see some common errors when trying to authenticate:
#### Error: Account is Disabled

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.
```
#### Error: Password is Incorrect

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.
```

#### Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1909 has occurred.

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.
```

# Credentialed
If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as `net.exe` to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as `PowerView`, `CrackMapExec` ported to Windows, `SharpMapExec`, `SharpView`, etc.
#### Using net.exe

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net accounts

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.
```

- Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
- The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
- The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
- Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes

#### Using PowerView

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy

Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}
SystemAccess   : @{MinimumPasswordAge=1; MaximumPasswordAge=-1; MinimumPasswordLength=8; PasswordComplexity=1;
                 PasswordHistorySize=24; LockoutBadCount=5; ResetLockoutCount=30; LockoutDuration=30;
                 RequireLogonToChangePassword=0; ForceLogoffWhenHourExpire=0; ClearTextPassword=0;
                 LSAAnonymousNameLookup=0}
KerberosPolicy : @{MaxTicketAge=10; MaxRenewAge=7; MaxServiceAge=600; MaxClockSkew=5; TicketValidateClient=1}
Version        : @{signature="$CHICAGO$"; Revision=1}
RegistryValues : @{MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash=System.Object[]}
Path           : \\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\sysvol\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHI
                 NE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf
GPOName        : {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy
```

PowerView gave us the same output as our `net accounts` command, just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled (`PasswordComplexity=1`).
