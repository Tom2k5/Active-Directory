## Setting Up
Our customer Inlanefreight has chosen the following approach because they are looking for as comprehensive an assessment as possible. At this time, their security program is not mature enough to benefit from any form of evasive testing or a "black box" approach.
- A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
- They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
- They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (`htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
- "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
- Non-evasive testing.
## Tasks
**Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:**
- Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
- This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
- Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!
#### Key Data Points

## TTPs
Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points.
1. Start with `passive` identification of any hosts in the network, followed by `active` validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.).
2. Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them.
3. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have.
=> At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

**Let's look at a few tools and techniques to help us with this enumeration.**
### Identifying Hosts

#### Wireshark

**First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on.**

- We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. 
- Notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below.
##### Start Wireshark on ea-attack01
```shell-session
─[htb-student@ea-attack01]─[~]
└──╼ $sudo -E wireshark

11:28:20.487     Main Warn QStandardPaths: runtime directory '/run/user/1001' is not owned by UID 0, but a directory permissions 0700 owned by UID 1001 GID 1002
<SNIP>
```

##### Wireshark Output

![](Pasted%20image%2020250606171020.png)

- ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: 172.16.5.5, 172.16.5.25 172.16.5.50, 172.16.5.100, and 172.16.5.125.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250606171406.png)

- MDNS makes us aware of the ACADEMY-EA-WEB01 host.

If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use [tcpdump](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump), [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds), and [NetMiner](https://www.netminer.com/en/product/netminer.php), etc., to perform the same functions. Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as `pktmon.exe`, which was added to all editions of Windows 10. 

```ad-note
As a note for testing, it's always a good idea to save the PCAP traffic you capture. You can review it again later to look for more hints, and it makes for great additional information to include while writing your reports.
```

Our first look at network traffic pointed us to a couple of hosts via `MDNS` and `ARP`.

**Now let's utilize a tool called `Responder` to analyze network traffic and determine if anything else in the domain pops up.**

#### Responder

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets.

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 -A 
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020250606181404.png)

Notice below that we found a few unique hosts not previously mentioned in our Wireshark captures. It's worth noting these down as we are starting to build a nice target list of IPs and DNS hostnames.

=> Our passive checks have given us a few hosts to note down for a more in-depth enumeration.

**Now let's perform some active checks starting with a quick ICMP sweep of the subnet using `fping`.**

#### FPing Active Checks
Here we'll start `fping` with a few flags: 
- `a` to show targets that are alive.
- `s` to print stats at the end of the scan.
- `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network.
- `q` to not show per-target results.

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23

172.16.5.5
172.16.5.25
172.16.5.50
172.16.5.100
172.16.5.125
172.16.5.200
172.16.5.225
172.16.5.238
172.16.5.240

     510 targets
       9 alive
     501 unreachable
       0 unknown addresses

    2004 timeouts (waiting for response)
    2013 ICMP Echos sent
       9 ICMP Echo Replies received
    2004 other ICMP received

 0.029 ms (min round trip time)
 0.396 ms (avg round trip time)
 0.799 ms (max round trip time)
       15.366 sec (elapsed real time)
```

The command above validates which hosts are active in the `/23` network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list.
=> From the `fping` command, we can see 9 "live hosts," including our attack host.

```ad-note
**Note:** Scan results in the target network will differ from the command output in this section due to the size of the lab network. It is still worth reproducing each example to practice how these tools work and note down every host that is live in this lab.
```

Combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap. **Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further.** 
#### Nmap Scanning
We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as `Domain Controllers` and `web servers`, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. 

Focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum
```

 For our **hosts.txt** file, some of our results from Responder and fping overlapped (we found the name and IP address), so to keep it simple, just the IP address was fed into **hosts.txt** for the scan.

**Domain Controller:**
```shell-session

Our scans have provided us with the naming standard used by NetBIOS and DNS, we can see some hosts have RDP open, and they have pointed us in the direction of the primary `Domain Controller` for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL).

```

We can see from the output above that we have a potential host running an outdated operating system ( Windows 7, 8, or Server 2008 based on the output). This is of interest to us since it means there are legacy operating systems running in this AD environment.

=> Means there is potential for older exploits like **EternalBlue**, MS08-067, and others to work and provide us with a **SYSTEM** level shell.

Taking equipment like that offline is costly and can hurt an organization, so legacy hosts are often left in place. Company will likely try to build a hard outer shell of Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other monitoring and protection solutions around those systems.

Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.). Now that we know what exists and what services are running, we can poll those servers and attempt to enumerate users.

We need to find our way to a domain user account or `SYSTEM` level access on a domain-joined host so we can gain a foothold and start the real fun. Let's dive into finding a user account.

---
### Identifying Users

If our client does not provide us with a user to start testing with (which is often the case), we will need to find a way to establish a foothold in the domain by either obtaining clear text credentials or an **NTLM** password hash for a user, a **SYSTEM** shell on a domain-joined host, or a shell in the context of a domain user account. Obtaining a valid user with credentials is critical in the early stages of an internal penetration test. This access (even at the lowest level) opens up many opportunities to perform enumeration and even attacks.

**Let's look at one way we can start gathering a list of valid users in a domain to use later in our assessment.**

#### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. 

=> Use the `jsmith.txt` or `jsmith2.txt` user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective.

**Now let's run through an example of using the tool to gather an initial username list.**

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users

2021/11/17 23:01:46 >  Using KDC(s):
2021/11/17 23:01:46 >   172.16.5.5:88
2021/11/17 23:01:46 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       jjones@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
2021/11/17 23:01:46 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       sbrown@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

2021/11/17 23:01:51 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       jhermann@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
2021/11/17 23:01:51 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       whouse@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
2021/11/17 23:01:51 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       emercer@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
2021/11/17 23:01:52 >  [+] VALID USERNAME:       wshepherd@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
2021/11/17 23:01:56 >  Done! Tested 48705 usernames (56 valid) in 9.940 seconds
```

We can see from our output that we validated 56 users in the **INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL** domain and it took only a few seconds to do so.

**Now we can take these results and build a list for use in targeted password spraying attacks.**

### Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

The [local system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A `SYSTEM` account on a `domain-joined` host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account.

There are several ways to gain `SYSTEM`-level access on a host, including but not limited to:
- Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
- Abusing a service running in the context of the `SYSTEM account`, or abusing the service account `SeImpersonate` privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
- Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems.
- Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using **Psexec** to launch a `SYSTEM` cmd window.

By gaining `SYSTEM`-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:
- Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
- Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
- Run tools such as Inveigh to gather **Net-NTLMv2** hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
- Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
- Carry out ACL attacks.
