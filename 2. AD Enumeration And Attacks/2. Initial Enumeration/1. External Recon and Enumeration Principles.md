Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform `external reconnaissance` of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:
- Validating information provided.
- Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope.
- Looking for any leaked information that is publicly accessible.

---
## What Are We Looking For?
When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible.

```ad-note
If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward.
```

The table below highlights the "`What`" in what we would be searching for during this phase of our engagement.

| **Data Point**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IP Space`           | Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Domain Information` | Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)                                                                                                                        |
| `Schema Format`      | Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Data Disclosures`   | For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain `intranet` site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.) |
| `Breach Data`        | Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Where Are We Looking?
Many different websites and tools can provide us with some or all of the information above that we could use to obtain information vital to our assessment. The table below lists a few potential resources and examples that can be used.

| **Resource**                     | **Examples**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication. |
### Finding Address Spaces

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606092840.png)

The `BGP-Toolkit` hosted by [Hurricane Electric](http://he.net/) is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within.
- Many large corporations will often self-host their infrastructure, and since they have such a large footprint, they will have their own ASN.
- Smaller organizations will often host their websites and other infrastructure in someone else's space (Cloudflare, Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure, for example). 

```ad-danger
Ensure we are not interacting with infrastructure out of our scope. If we are not careful while pentesting against a smaller organization, we could end up inadvertently causing harm to another organization sharing that infrastructure.

In some cases, your client may need to get written approval from a third-party hosting provider before you can test.

Questions around self-hosted or 3rd party managed infrastructure should be handled during the scoping process and be clearly listed in any scoping documents you receive.
```

### DNS
DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start.

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606094319.png)

### Public Data
Social media can be a treasure trove of interesting data that can clue us in to how the organization is structured, what kind of equipment they operate, potential software and security implementations, their schema, and more.
=> On top of that list are job-related sites like LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Glassdoor.

You can learn a lot about an organization just from what they post, and a well-intentioned post could disclose data relevant to us as penetration testers.
##### **Sharepoint Admin Job Listing**

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606094824.png)

##### Other public data
Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. 

=> Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure.

With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. For example, a dev working on a project may accidentally leave some credentials or notes hardcoded into a code release.

=> Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

---
## Enumeration Principles
Keeping in mind that our goal is to understand our target better, we are looking for every possible avenue we can find that will provide us with a potential route to the inside. Besides the customer's scoping document, we have to do for ourselves.
- First use `passive` resources, starting wide in scope and narrowing down.
- Once we exhaust our initial run of passive enumeration, we will need to examine the results and then move into our active enumeration phase.

---
## Example
Practice our enumeration tactics on the `inlanefreight.com` domain without performing any active scans.

**Start first by checking our Netblocks data**
#### Check for ASN/IP & Domain Data

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606101556.png)

##### **Report:**
- IP Address: 134.209.24.248
- Mail Server: mail1.inlanefreight.com
- Nameservers: NS1.inlanefreight.com & NS2.inlanefreight.com
=> **Inlanefreight** is not a large corporation, so we didn't expect to find that it had its own ASN.

**Now let's validate some of this information.**
#### Viewdns Results

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606101824.png)

In the request above, we utilized `viewdns.info` to validate the IP address of our target. Both results match, which is a good sign. 

**Now let's try another route to validate the two nameservers in our results.**

```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ nslookup ns1.inlanefreight.com

Server:		192.168.186.1
Address:	192.168.186.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns1.inlanefreight.com
Address: 178.128.39.165

TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ nslookup ns2.inlanefreight.com
Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns2.inlanefreight.com
Address: 206.189.119.186 
```

We now have `two` new IP addresses to add to our list for validation and testing. Before taking any further action with them, ensure they are in-scope for your test. For our purposes, the actual IP addresses would not be in scope for scanning, but we could passively browse any websites to hunt for interesting data. That is it with enumerating domain information from DNS. 

**Let's take a look at the publicly available information**

Inlanefreight is a fictitious company that we are using for this module, so there is no real social media presence. Instead, we will move on to examining the website `inlanefreight.com`.

**The first check we ran was looking for any documents.** Using `filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com` as a search, we are looking for PDFs.
#### Hunting For Files

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606104739.png)

One document popped up, so we need to ensure we note the document and its location and download a copy locally to dig through. It is always best to save files, screenshots, scan output, tool output, etc., as soon as we come across them or generate them.

=> This helps us keep as comprehensive a record as possible and not risk forgetting where we saw something or losing critical data.

**Next, let's look for any email addresses we can find.**
#### Hunting E-mail Addresses

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606105136.png)

Using the dork `intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com`, we are looking for any instance that appears similar to the end of an email address on the website.

=> One promising result came up with a contact page.

Browsing the [contact page](https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/contact/), we can see several emails for staff in different offices around the globe. We now have an idea of their email naming convention (first.last) and where some people work in the organization. This could be handy in later password spraying attacks or if social engineering/phishing were part of our engagement scope.

![](../../Image/Pasted%20image%2020250606110813.png)

#### Username Harvesting
We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

#### Credential Hunting
[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

**Example:**
```shell-session
TomTank05@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -p

id : 5996447501
email : roger.grimes@inlanefreight.local
username : rgrimes
password : Ilovefishing!
hashed_password : 
name : Roger Grimes
vin : 
address : 
phone : 
database_name : ModBSolutions

id : 7344467234
email : jane.yu@inlanefreight.local
username : jyu
password : Starlight1982_!
hashed_password : 
name : Jane Yu
vin : 
address : 
phone : 
database_name : MyFitnessPal

<SNIP>
```

```ad-note
`Note`: The script used in the example above can be found [here](https://github.com/mrb3n813/Pentest-stuff/blob/master/dehashed.py). Due to changes in the API structure of DeHashed, modifications may be necessary. Alternatively, the following [script](https://github.com/sm00v/Dehashed) could be used. Before executing the script, it is crucial to become familiar with its functionality.
